# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started looking into Scala. Went through and wrote basic scala code to test Mixan class composition, nested and high order functions, and currying.

**Thoughts:** The scala syntax is giving me trouble while I try to understand the existing scala examples. Should get better with time.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1. Coded Quicksort in scala using both functional and imperative programming paradigm. 2. Started working on my portfolio webpage. Put a basic navigation bar in place. 

**Thoughts:** Scala syntax still continues to give me trouble. Need more hands on practice to get comfortable. Also, navbar of bootstrap was a totally new thing I had to deal with. I might do some more navbar improvement for my portfolio website.
