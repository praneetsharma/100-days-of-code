# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started looking into Scala. Went through and wrote basic scala code to test Mixan class composition, nested and high order functions, and currying.

**Thoughts:** The scala syntax is giving me trouble while I try to understand the existing scala examples. Should get better with time.
